Starting with CSS: A Professional Approach
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style HTML elements. It controls the layout, appearance, and behavior of web pages. Letâ€™s build a solid foundation by covering CSS concepts systematically, followed by a detailed breakdown of the styles.css file I shared earlier.

Core CSS Concepts:

1. Selectors:
	- Used to target HTML elements for styling.

Examples:

	h1 { color: blue; } /* Targets all <h1> elements */
	.class-name { margin: 10px; } /* Targets elements with the class "class-name" */
	#id-name { padding: 5px; } /* Targets the element with the ID "id-name" */

2. Properties and Values:

	- Each style rule consists of properties (what you want to style) and values (how you want to style it).
		color: red; /* Sets text color to red */
		font-size: 16px; /* Sets font size */

3. Box Model:

	- Every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box with these layers:
	- Content: The actual content of the element.
	- Padding: Space between the content and the border.
	- Border: A boundary around the padding.
	- Margin: Space between the element and other elements.
	
- Visualization:

+-------------------+
|     Margin        |
|  +------------+   |
|  |  Border    |   |
|  | +--------+ |   |
|  | | Padding | |   |
|  | | Content | |   |
|  | +--------+ |   |
|  +------------+   |
+-------------------+

4. Units:

	- Common units in CSS:
		- px (pixels): Absolute units.
		- %: Relative to the parent element.
		- em, rem: Relative to font size.

5. Typography:

	- Controls text styling.
	- Common properties: font-size, font-family, text-align, line-height.
